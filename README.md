# 🌐 Decentralized MCP Registry

A peer-to-peer (P2P) registry system for Model Control Protocol (MCP) servers, inspired by BitTorrent protocols. This decentralized solution enables seamless tool discovery and delegation without central points of failure or control.

## 🚀 Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Fully P2P network without central points of control
- **Tool Discovery**: Unified MCP server interface with composite tools catalog
- **Direct Tool Invocation**: Seamless relay of tool invocations across the network
- **Version Management**: Support for multiple tool versions and dependencies
- **Security & Trust**: Cryptographic verification and web of trust model
- **Monetization**: Built-in micro-billing framework with mutual clearing capabilities

## 📋 Requirements

## 🛠️ Development Status

Currently in initial development phase, focusing on:
- Basic P2P connectivity
- Simple tool registry with metadata
- Core relay functionality
- Basic tool discovery
- Cryptographic verification
- Local tool execution support
