# üåê Decentralized MCP Server Registry ‚Äî Product Requirements

## üéØ Product Vision
Create a fully decentralized P2P registry for MCP servers using BitTorrent-inspired protocols that maintains the same seamless delegation capabilities as centralized registries but without central points of failure or control.

## üß† Core Functionality (AI Client Perspective)

### Tool Discovery & Access
- Present as a unified MCP server with composite tools catalog
- Allow direct tool invocation through the decentralized network
- Transparently relay invocations to appropriate MCP servers
- Maintain consistency of tool interfaces across the network

### Interaction Model
- Support standard MCP protocol for tool invocation
- Provide consistent response handling and error patterns
- Enable discovery of new tools as they join the network
- Support versioning of tools to ensure compatibility

## üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Operator Functionality

### Registry Management
- Register local MCP servers to the P2P network
- Define tool visibility, permissions and delegation settings
- Control which tools are shared with the network
- Tag and organize tools with metadata

### Network Operations
- Join existing P2P networks of MCP registries
- Discover other nodes and their available tools
- Contribute to distributed hash tables (DHT) for tool discovery
- Track network health and node reputation

### Tool Package Management
- Discover available tools that can be run locally
- Download, install, and configure tools for local execution
- Manage dependencies and requirements for local tools
- Implement semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) for all tools
- Support multiple parallel versions of the same tool
- Provide rollback capabilities to previous versions
- Maintain a local version cache to revert even if remote source is unavailable
- Update local tools to newer versions when available

## üí∞ Monetization Requirements

### Micro-Billing Framework
- Record all billable tool invocations with transaction records mutually signed by both parties
- Each transaction must be cryptographically signed by both the consumer (A) and provider (B) to be valid
- Support per-call, time-based, and subscription billing models for remote tool usage
- For locally run tools, billing applies only to setup, updates, or licensing (not per-invocation)
- Enable tool providers to set and adjust pricing dynamically for different usage models
- Support different billing models for the same tool depending on deployment (local vs. remote)
- Track usage metrics for billing purposes

### Distributed Billing Process
- Maintain local ledgers of all transactions between directly interacting nodes only
- Store identical, mutually-signed billing records exclusively on the instances involved in the transaction (e.g., if A uses B, records exist only on A and B, not on C or D)
- Require cryptographic proof of both parties' confirmation for each transaction
- Cross-validate transaction records between participating parties during reconciliation
- Schedule periodic billing reconciliation (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Identify and resolve circular debts through mutual clearing ("–≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–∑–∞—á—ë—Ç—ã") only among directly connected transaction chains
- Optimize partial circular debt clearing to maximize debt reduction in any connected chain
- Reduce transaction fees and tax implications through efficient mutual clearing

### Fiat Currency Integration
- Support standard fiat currencies for billing and payments
- Generate formal invoices compliant with financial regulations
- Integrate with payment processors for automated settlements
- Manage currency conversion when transactions cross currency boundaries

### Financial Administration
- Provide billing dashboards for users and providers
- Generate financial reports for accounting purposes
- Support audit trails for all financial transactions
- Implement configurable payment thresholds and schedules

- Include cryptographic fingerprints as part of tool identity
- Support discovery by capability/function rather than just name
- Allow local aliases with global unique identifiers to prevent naming collisions

### Security & Trust
- Implement cryptographic verification of registry entries
